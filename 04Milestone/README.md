## 📤  [Share flags](https://github.com/mbevanda/100-days-of-swift/tree/main/04Milestone "Title")

Challenge is to create an app that lists various world flags in a table view. When one of them is tapped, detail view controller 
slides in and it contains an image view, showing the same flag full size. 
On the detail view controller, there's an action button that lets the user share the flag picture and country name.

<p float = "left"> 
 <img src="/04Milestone/Mockups/image1.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
 <img src="/04Milestone/Mockups/image2.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
</p>
