## 💁 [Names to Faces](https://github.com/mbevanda/100-days-of-swift/tree/main/013NamesToFaces "Title")

This fun, simple and useful project is created for those people who are just bad at putting names to faces. This app can be used as storage for names of people you've met. 
User can also select an image from their camera to import into an app.
