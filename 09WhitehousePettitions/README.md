## 🌐  [Whitehouse Petition](https://github.com/mbevanda/100-days-of-swift/tree/main/09WhitehousePettitions "Title")

In this project focus was on learning how to download JSON using Swift’s Data type, then use the Codable protocol to convert that data into Swift objects we defined.
We used Swift’s Codable system to parse our JSON into array of petitions which is populating table view. User have ability to serch through petitions
using key words and see more detail information about selected petition.
